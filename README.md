# FeatureNet
This is a re-implementation of FeatureNet in Tensorflow 2. FeatureNet is a deep learning architecture for machining feature recognition that utilises a voxel representation and 3D CNN. 

The code can be found on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/qub_femg/machine-learning/featurenet-tensorflow-2).

The code is based on this original [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010448518301349). This paper's original code can be found [here](https://github.com/zibozzb/FeatureNet) and dataset is available [here](https://github.com/madlabub/Machining-feature-dataset).
